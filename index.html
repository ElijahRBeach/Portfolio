    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Elijah Beach. I'm a graduate of Eleven Fifty Academy's Coding Foundations and Software Development courses. After spending many years bouncing around in various jobs in the retail and food industry, I finally found my calling with coding and software development. Below I have examples of some of my work, and if you like what you see, I'd love for you to reach out to me!</p>

        <p>This was my final project for Eleven Fifty Academy's software development course. The Travel Log Web App is a .NET Framework MVC 5 Web Application that uses n-tier architecture and is deployed to azure. It was created with the intention of letting people log places they've travelled to by Country, State, and City.</p>
